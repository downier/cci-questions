//Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (ie, any node but the first and the last)
//of a singly linked list, given only access to that node

//EXAMPLE
// Input: the node c from the linked list a > b > c > d > e > f
// Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a > b > d > e > f
